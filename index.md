# DC Code Convergence 2018

Thanks to everyone who'll be coming to work with us at the DC Code Convergence next week.  
### EVERYONE: Please have these downloaded before Monday morning!  
The wifi at the FAES SAC is pretty good, but if we're all downloading large volumes of data at the same time, it's going to start to drag a bit.  
* [Have a working AFNI install](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/background_install/install_instructs/index.html)
* [Download the the test dataset (watch out, this is 5.5 GB)](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/data/misc/UCLA_pamenc20.tgz)
* [Download the AFNI Build docker image]()

### If you think you might want the AFNI Bootcamp data next week, download them here

* [Bootcamp Data Expanded](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/edu/data/CD.expanded)

### Where
We'll be at the FAES Social and Academic Center (SAC) ([9101 Old Georgetown Rd, Bethesda, MD](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Foundation+For+Advanced+Ed/@39.0051452,-77.1125235,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7cbe4fb559a17:0xadfa07f7521a5d37!8m2!3d39.005099!4d-77.110339?shorturl=1)).

### When

From 9:00 am to 6:00 pm-ish Monday, September 10th to Friday, September 14th.
Wednesday evening there will be a celebration at Bob's house - about 1 mile from the FAES center.

### What

Bob will do an introductory [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-qEq1UpvjfpRm1xcy1nQ25SWi1tUWE4b0NOZUhWVmlBWDI4/view?usp=sharing) on Monday at 10:00 am, covering some aspects of AFNI that will be helpful for hacking with it that you might not be totally familiar with. Other than that, we'll run the week with relatively little formal structure. If there are topics, packages, tools, etc. that anyone would like to discuss, we'll pick a time and announce it on this mailing list, Slack, and maybe Bob's twitter feed @AFNIman.

### Eating

Since we're a little bit isolated over at the FAES SAC, we'll be ordering in for lunches.

### Code of conduct

The DC Code Convergence is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the DC Code Convergence staff. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
Sexual images in public spaces
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
Harassing photography or recording
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate physical contact
Unwelcome sexual attention
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

#### Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

#### Reporting
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. 

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous Report
You can make an anonymous report here https://goo.gl/forms/pYI3lvs72NuxYpJ82.
We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

#### Personal Report
You can make a personal report by:
Calling or messaging this phone number: 864-650-6005. This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.
Contacting a member of the DC code convergence organizing committee, including Bob Cox, Adam Thomas, or Dylan Nielson.
When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
